Watermarking Desktop App (Python + Tkinter + Pillow)

A simple yet powerful Python desktop application that lets you add text or logo watermarks to your images with just a few clicks — no need for Photoshop or online tools.

Features:
Upload single or multiple images
Add a custom text watermark or upload a logo image
Adjust opacity/transparency of the watermark
Preview the watermarked image in real time
Save final images to your desired folder
Built-in batch watermarking for multiple photos

Tech Stack:
Python 3.x
Tkinter – for the GUI
Pillow (PIL) – for image processing

Install the required dependencies:
pip install pillow

Run the application:
python app.py

How It Works
Upload Image(s): Choose one or multiple images from your computer.
Add Watermark:
Option 1: Upload a logo (PNG with transparency recommended)
Option 2: Enter text (like your name or website).
Adjust Opacity: Control how visible the watermark is.
Preview & Save: Check the live preview and export your watermarked images.

Example Use Case

You’re a photographer or content creator posting online.
Instead of manually editing each photo, use this app to automatically watermark your images with your name or logo — fast and consistent.

Future Improvements

Add custom font for text
Export app as an .exe file for Windows users
Include drag-and-drop upload
